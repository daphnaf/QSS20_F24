This influences sentencing both through sentencing guidelines, which can prescribe longer sentences for those who have certain types of prior convictions, and through judicial discretion if judges are more lenient with first-time defendants. The above sources discuss how much we want to \"control away\" for this prior history, since if we think there are racial biases in which defendants, conditional on *committing* a crime, are arrested and charged, we may not want to adjust for that factor.
